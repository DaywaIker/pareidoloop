==========

1. generate random polygons
2. feed them into a face detector
3. mutate to increase recognition confidence

difficult stuff (the cv lib) by [liuliu]

notes
=====
* try out a [demo]
* currently tested only in chrome (v. 21)
* slows dramatically with larger canvas sizes (todo: give a scaled version to the ccv algo)
* probably a bunch of bugs in there
